Cache-CacheFactory

Cache::CacheFactory provides a factory class for building caches,
it can behave in most situations as a drop-in replacement for
any of the Cache::Cache subclasses, but then allows you to be
more flexible in your choice of storage or expiry policies or
to write new ones of your own.

Some benefits include:

- Mix-and-match policies rather than needing to build a whole
  new Cache:Cache subclass for each unique combination of policies.

- Have multiple policies on a single cache. Want a size-aware
  against-file-modification-time 15-minute memory cache?
  No problem.

- Module author and don't know what caches are available on
  the destination system?
  Use of Class:Factory ensures that only the modules they
  have installed will be used and allows you to get a list
  so you can choose the best fit for your needs.

- Easy to extend with new expiry policies or Cache::Cache-compatible
  storage policies.
